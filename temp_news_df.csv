37,exit polls work whether trust,frustrating thing election day one actually information going election night later thanks exit polls conducted immediately sample voters cast ballots get early early idea race shaken votes counted news outlets take long release exit poll data really reliable heres need know poll shape way understand 2014 midterm elections exit polls work every november election exit polls conducted group media outlets called national election pool nbc cbs abc fox cnn associated press hire pollster conduct exit poll theyre ones information get first report results actual polling conducted army thousands interviewers get sent hundreds polling places around country interviewers approach certain number voters leaving polling place exact fraction surveyed secret ask fill written exit poll survey early voting become popular gotten harder predict vote totals talking people vote election day 2008 exit pollsters started conducting preelection phone polls ask people theyd already voted could factor early voters projections learn exit polls primary purpose exit poll allow tv networks ap project whos races soon polls close possible thats question exit poll asks voters asked provide basic demographic information like gender age ethnicity furthermore theyre asked questions personal viewpoints behaviors like religion churchgoing habits questions major issues facing country means exit poll data actually detailed ways official us census vote tallies come several weeks election offer first hints often important ones voters thought election about thats important pundits try interpret means 2004 example postelection chatter focused values voters voters attended religious services regularly overwhelmingly voted george w bush narrative came exit poll data course voters say important partly campaigns told voters important theres political science research suggesting campaign hammers particular issues issues candidates supporters say important them exit poll still best opportunity national media has ways figure voted why how public get find exit poll results media outlets running exit poll want able describe whos voting theyre voting for public early possible want influence ends voting want anyone deciding vote theyve already seen exit polls say think vote matter theres evidence happened back 1980 outlets projected ronald reagan would win presidential election polls closed west coast countries like united kingdom actually illegal media outlet report exit poll results polls close us illegal theres binding agreement among media outlets run exit poll none allowed leak results polls closed since participating organizations want locked future exit polls every reason break agreement reporters allowed see exit poll results theyre compiled day theyre superstrict security were talking nophonesallowedintheroomwheretheresultsarekept levels security theres strictly regimented schedule exit poll results get released around 5 pm et media outlets allowed start reporting exit poll says turned vote racial age party breakdown voters preliminary results theyre going skewed toward people voted early day groups tend vote later day like young voters might underrepresented stats first get announced soon polls close particular state media outlets allowed project whos going win elections there based exit poll results deepblue deepred states outcome election really doubt media outlets waste time projecting winners minute 7 pm hits east coast example expect see cnn ap make bunch projections once states closer races media outlets often wait get final exit poll results including people voted right polls closed  wait see actual vote tallies stack precincts start reporting official vote totals exit poll results ever get leaked never actual leaked exit poll us plenty hoaxes see anyone facebook sharing leaked exit poll results polls still open very skeptical definitely decide vote saw something leaked exit poll exit polls always right no fact particular challenges exit polls faced last several elections still found way work out early voters phone poll early voters new addition exit poll clear kinks worked yet runs problems phone poll namely difficult poll people mobile phones furthermore exit pollsters typically earlyvote polling every state 2012 15 states got earlyvote polling small groups like poll smaller sample size is less likely representative exit poll pretty reliable comes large demographics men women democrats republicans gets less reliable gets small demographics young voters jewish voters  voters color addition general problems smaller voting demographics analysts believe exit poll tendency oversample particular kind voter color kind lives majoritywhite areas heres logic even though public know exactly exit poll chooses go possible make educated guesses exit poll trying predict margin victory one candidate another across state decides polling places put interviewers outside of reasonable assume choosing lots swing precincts precincts harder predict likely affect outcome going largely white precincts alternatively says matt barreto latino decisions exit pollsters might choose precinct benchmark based last cycle example precinct voted democratic senator 70 percent 30 percent 2008 pollster might choose put exitpoll interviewer precinct see democrats getting less 70 percent vote time around theyre necessarily paying attention racial makeup precincts heres problem voters color pollsters run majoritywhite precincts might representative voters color across state particular according latino decisions voters color living among whites assimilated better educated higher income conservative minority voters check difference percent nonwhite voters college degree 2010 according us census vs exit poll problems even worse latino voters exit polls almost never offered spanish even though quarter latino voters prefer spanish english exit polls oversample englishspeaking latinos issues together mean exit polls sometimes think latino voters much favorable republicans actually are 2010 example harry reid reelection senate turning latinos vote republican challenger sharron angle running hardcore immigration hawk according exit polls 30 percent nevada latinos voted angle many voted john mccain president 2008 official vote tallies came out became clear 90 percent latinos voted reid exit polls usually biased toward republicans nope matter fact even issues listed above exit polls historically biased toward democrats often theyve biased toward republicans 2004 example exit polls overestimated john kerrys share vote one standard error 26 states overestimated george w bushs share 4 states reason error bush voters likely kerry voters refuse answer pollsters questions left voting booth often exit polls get outcome wrong honestly often errors exit polls enough get outcome race wrong might misstate much victor by supported himher most polls close election day cnn immediately projects preferred candidate senate going lose election hold breath eventual victory go around election night party shouting unskew exit polls unskewedpolls jokes
